This is a customer-facing business website for Gary Ave. Gold Honey Co. It uses HTML and CSS/Bootstrap. On the main page there is a Boostrap image carousell. Images are served via AWS S3 buckets.

| Live deploy through digital ocean| Refactor with React |
| Bash script built for easy github integration | Add a CMS |


## Biggest challenges
Not to using a framework on this seemed like the easy way to go at the begining, but, not being able to use jinja templates or reusable React components definitely led to the html getting unwieldy. This project would be a great candidate for a static react generating framework like Gatsby.
